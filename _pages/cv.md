## About Me

Hey ‚Äî I‚Äôm someone who thinks a little differently about the digital world.  
I‚Äôve spent years deep inside code, systems, and networks ‚Äî not just building them, but breaking them apart to understand how they really work.  
I‚Äôm a hacker by mindset, not just by skill.

I don‚Äôt take anything at face value. I question. I explore. I dig into what most overlook.

This space is where I share ideas, tools, and techniques from the edges of:

- Red Team Tactics  
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Analysis  
- Vulnerability Research & Reverse Engineering  
- OSINT Recon & Exploitation  
- Firewall Evasion & IDS Bypass  
- Malware Behavior & Sandbox Evasion  
- Exploit Development  
- Infrastructure Hacking  

Sometimes it‚Äôs technical, sometimes it‚Äôs reflective ‚Äî but always real.  

If you care about truth, freedom, and the hidden layers of the internet,  
you‚Äôll probably feel right at home here.
